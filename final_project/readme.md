# Is The Whole Greater Than The Sum Of Its Parts?

### Project Overview:
In this study, we examine whether "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts?" in the context of data integration. Specifically, we investigate whether combining multiple data sources leads to improved predictive performance and deeper insights. To streamline the data science workflow, we leverage automated machine learning (AutoML) tools for pipeline optimization and error analysis. By systematically evaluating models trained on individual and combined datasets, we assess the impact of data fusion on accuracy and interpretability. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating diverse data sources (in the same or realted domain) to enhance model robustness and decision-making.

NOTE - To download h2o you need to have java installed, [see instructions here](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html#requirements)

NOTE - The football dataset couldn't be uploaded to git because its bigger then gits file size limit. To run the football related code, download the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores/data), copy "appearances.csv" and "players.csv" to "/data/football/raw/"
